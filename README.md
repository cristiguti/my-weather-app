# üå¶Ô∏è My Weather App

## Framework I Chose and Why
For this project, I chose **React (JavaScript)** as my framework. React is one of the most popular tools for building interactive and dynamic websites. It is especially good for making single-page applications where the content updates without needing to reload the entire page. I decided to use React because I already had a little knowledge with basic web development (HTML, CSS, and JavaScript), so React felt like a natural next step for me to learn.  

Another reason I picked React is because it is beginner-friendly but also powerful enough for professional projects. It uses components, which means I could break my project into smaller pieces and focus on one part at a time instead of getting overwhelmed by the whole app. This made the coding process much easier to manage. Learning React for this project helped me practice how modern websites are actually built in the real world.

## API I Chose and Why
The API I used is the **OpenWeatherMap API**, which provides real-time weather data. I chose this API because it is free for small projects, simple to use, and very well-documented. It returns data in **JSON format**, which works perfectly with JavaScript and made it easier for me to read and display information on my website.  

By using this API, I was able to fetch live weather conditions such as temperature and weather description, and then show them directly in my React app. This was my first time connecting a frontend app with an external API, and I learned how powerful it is to bring real-world data into an application. It made my project more interactive and useful, instead of just showing static text.
